## Quick overview
So we have a pdf file, no interresting strings or metadata, we can analyse the objects included in the file

## Solution
First, we will take a look at the pdf file using `peepdf` to analyse the objects of the files looking for embeded files or hidden scripts
Actually that was the first idea, but nothing is found
Then I tried to convert the pdf to other format maybe there is data that can be clear in other format
I used `pdftohtml` then welcome dear flag: `amateursCTF{0ut_0f_b0unds}`
